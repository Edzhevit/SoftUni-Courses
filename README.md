# SoftUni-Courses

## Task
Write the HTML and JavaScript code to make the SoftUni Courses functionality work as follows: 

This season SoftUni has focused solely on Java courses. That’s awesome, right? The available courses are:

* Java Fundamentals – 170 BGN
* Java Advanced - 180 BGN
* Java DB - 190 BGN
* Java Web - 490 BGN

The offered education forms are Onsite and Online.
The Java Fundamentals, Java Advanced and Java DB courses form a whole Module.
Fortunately, there are some cases where students receive a discount:

* If Java Advanced is combined with Java Fundamentals, the student receives a 10% discount on Java Advanced.
* If all three courses are selected (Java Fundamentals, Java Advanced and Java DB), students receive a module discount - 6% on the module's total price.
* If all available courses are selected, students get a bonus course - 'HTML and CSS'.
* Students also get a discount if their education form is online - 6% on all courses.

You need to CCC:
* Check which courses and education form are selected.
* Create a list item for every course and append it to the given unordered list.
* Calculate the total price of all courses the student has signed up for and update the cost.
 
Hint
* A student can receive more than one discount.
* The courses’ cost needs to be rounded to the closest integer, followed by two zeros.
